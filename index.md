### Research:

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute on the Environment (IonE) working at the intersection of data science and sustainability. A physicist by training, my primary expertise is in modeling, data analysis and visualization, and thinking about complex systems.  

My current research focuses on the environmental impacts of different types of land use in the United States. I work on developing IonEâ€™s Food System Supply-Chain Sustainability (FoodS3) model, tracing the impacts of US agriculture through the supply chain. I am also involved in a joint project between IonE and the US Forest Service on carbon accounting, using geospatial data to create detailed maps of carbon sources and sinks. 

I started my academic career as a physicist, and wrote my PhD dissertation on black hole images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an experiment to image the near-horizon region of a supermassive black hole for the first time. Building on existing data analysis techniques, but with a code built from scratch, we investigated what these reconstructed black hole images can tell us about the nature of the source. We published several papers analyzing the 2017 data on M87* (a super-massive black hole candidate located at the core of the galaxy M87) in which we confirm some of the EHT collaboration's main results, and found something new: we show that a subtle change in the so-called 'likelihood function' used to compare the data to a model can affect one of the key parameters of interest, the width of the observed ring. The width is very interesting, as it has the potential to distinguish between different astrophysical situations (how close to the black hole does the accretion disk peak in emissivity, for example). The preprint of our paper can be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06948).

Before that I worked on modeling pulsar light curves. Together with professors [Dimitrios Psaltis](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/), and [Feryal Ozel](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~fozel/), we compared models of the ray-traced thermal emission from the neutron star surface with observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, in an effort to improve constraints on the mass-radius relationship of these amazing objects. Our paper on the subject can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11534).

<!-- My research focuses on *pulsars* - rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit a characteristic pattern of electromagnetic radiation in radio and x-rays. Together with professors [Sam Gralla](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/sam-gralla), [Dimitrios Psaltis](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/), and [Feryal Ozel](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~fozel/), I am using computer simulations to model the radiation emitted by these stars. Hidden in these light curves are clues to the mysteries of the neutron star interior, and the nature of ultra-dense matter beyond the nuclear saturation density. By comparing our models with new observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, we hope to improve the known constraints on the size, magnetic field, and other fundamental properties of these astounding objects. 

Our first paper can be found on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11534).  -->

### Teaching:

I have three years' experience as a teaching assistant (TA) for the freshman undergraduate physics courses at the [UofA](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/): 141 (Mechanics) and 241 (Electricity & Magnetism). 

I am a nationally ranked 5-dan amateur Go player, and I have taught Go both in private lessons and group workshops.

### My film:

From 2012-2016 I directed a feature-length documentary film on the game of Go, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/). The project was a labor of love, a worldly adventure, and my attempt to synthesize all the emotions and philosophical questions the game inspires in me. The movie is  available to buy or rent on the website through Vimeo-on-Demand - go watch it! Or see the [Film](film.md) tab for more info.

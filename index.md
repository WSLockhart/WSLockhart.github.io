Welcome to my website! 

I am a Research Fellow at the [Institute on the Environment (IonE)](https://environment.umn.edu/staff/will-lockhart/) working at the intersection of data science and sustainability. A physicist by training, I have expertise in modeling, data analysis and visualization, and thinking about complex systems in general. Lately I've become focused on the ecological [overshoot crisis](TheOvershootCrisis.pdf) and questions around how humanity can create a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable future.

### Research:

My current research focuses on the environmental impacts of land use in the United States. Agriculture now takes up [nearly half of all habitable land](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use) on Earth (the majority of which goes to feeding livestock), and is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater depletion, and biodiversity loss. At the same time, food is essential for human survival - so to create a sustainable world we must fix our agricultural system. I work on developing IonEâ€™s Food System Supply-chain Sustainability (FoodS<sup>3</sup>) model, which traces the impacts of US agriculture through the food supply chain. This will enable more accurate, region-specific carbon footprinting for the meat and dairy industries. I am also involved in a joint project between IonE and the US Forest Service on carbon accounting, using geospatial data to create detailed maps of carbon sources and sinks.

We must remember that human beings are a part of the natural world, and our survival depends on the life-giving power of the planet's ecosystems.

I started my academic career as a physicist, studying the astrophysics of compact objects. I wrote my PhD dissertation on black hole images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an experiment to image the near-horizon region of a supermassive black hole for the first time. Building on existing data analysis techniques, but with a code designed from scratch, professor Sam Gralla and I investigated what these reconstructed images tell us about the nature of the source. We published several papers analyzing the 2017 data on M87* (a super-massive black hole candidate located at the core of the galaxy M87) in which we confirmed some of the EHT collaboration's main results, and found something new: we show that a subtle change in the so-called 'likelihood function' used to compare model with data can affect one of the key parameters of interest, the width of the observed ring. The width is very interesting, as it has the potential to distinguish between different astrophysical scenarios. You can find these two papers here: _On the Width of the Observed Ring in M87*_ [Part 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06948), [Part 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09989).

I also spent some time working on pulsars. Together with professors Dimitrios Psaltis and Feryal Ozel, we compared models of the ray-traced thermal emission from the neutron star surface with observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, in an effort to improve constraints on the mass-radius relationship of these amazing objects. Our paper on the subject can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11534).

My research focuses on *pulsars* - rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit a characteristic pattern of electromagnetic radiation in radio and x-rays. Together with professors [Sam Gralla](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/sam-gralla), [Dimitrios Psaltis](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/), and [Feryal Ozel](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~fozel/), I am using computer simulations to model the radiation emitted by these stars. Hidden in these light curves are clues to the mysteries of the neutron star interior, and the nature of ultra-dense matter beyond the nuclear saturation density. By comparing our models with new observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, we hope to improve the known constraints on the size, magnetic field, and other fundamental properties of these astounding objects. 

Our first paper can be found on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11534).  -->

### Teaching:

I enjoy the challenge of boiling down complex problems and conveying abstract ideas to a general audience. I have several years' experience as a teaching assistant (TA) for the freshman undergraduate physics courses at the University of Arizona: 141 (Mechanics) and 241 (Electricity & Magnetism). 

I am a nationally ranked 5-dan Go player, and I have taught Go both in private lessons and group workshops.

### My film:

From 2012-2016 I directed a feature-length documentary film, [*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/), about the game of Go. The project was a labor of love, a worldly adventure, and my attempt to synthesize all the emotions and philosophical questions the game inspires in me. The movie is available to buy or rent on the website through Vimeo-on-Demand - go watch it! Or see the [Film](film.md) tab for more info.

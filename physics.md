> "Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry." - Richard Feynman

What is reality, and how can we understand it? More precisely, how can we construct mathematical models to describe the patterns we observe in Nature? This is the starting point for the most fundamental of all the branches of science. On this page you'll find a few of my favorite resources, past projects, and other miscellanea related to the study of physics.

### My Research:

My research focuses on *pulsars* - rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit a characteristic pattern of electromagnetic radiation in radio and x-rays. I am working with professors [Sam Gralla](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/sam-gralla), [Dimitrios Psaltis](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/), and [Feryal Ozel](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~fozel/) to model the radiation emitted by these stars using computer simulations. The detailed structure of these light curves contain clues to the properties of neutron stars and the mechanism that produces their exotic x-ray emission. If we can understand the subtle relationship between the properties of these pulsars and the shape of their light curves, we can actually learn something about the exotic ultra-dense nuclear matter of which they are composed. Our first paper describing our apporach to light curve modeling can be found on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11534).

My current project is to compare the results of our model with the most recent data from NASA's Neutron-star Interior Composition ExploreR ([NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer)). In order to do this analysis, I am using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to find the set of model parameters which best fit the observed data. We expect to report on this next year!

### Other Projects / Code:

* **Asteroids**: a Newtonian gravity simulator. Download the [python code](https://github.com/WSLockhart/Asteroids)
* **Particle Mesh Code**: Last spring I co-wrote a particle mesh code for a course in cosmology. The code loosely simulates large-scale structure formation in the universe. Check out one of the final videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPW5df8Cvrc)
* **On the Shoulders of Giants**: A project to compile the all-time great pedagogical physics problems. I hope that someday this can be a lovely resource for students and teachers alike. Problem suggestions are welcome! You can see a sample page [here](/docs/TimelessProblems_sample.pdf)

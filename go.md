# The Game of Go

> "The rules of Go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical    
that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe   
they almost certainly play Go." - Edward Lasker

Go is one of the oldest board games in the world, and the ultimate game of pure strategy. Two players, black and white, take turns placing stones on the intersections of a square grid in an effort to surround territory. If a group of stones is completely surrounded on all sides by the opposing color, it is captured and taken off the board. The player with the most points of territory at the end of the game wins. From these simple rules emerges an incredible depth of strategy and creativity, manifested in the beautiful patterns that swirl and spread across the board.

At it's heart, Go is about *balance*: you want to enclose territory as quickly and efficiently as possible, but if you overextend your stones will be cut and captured. Playing Go well requires a surprising breadth of thought, utilizing both 'left-brain' analytical calculation and 'right-brain' intuition and judgment. It's the most beautiful game I know, and I'm always happy to introduce others to the game!

# The Surrounding Game: a documentary film

---

![film image](/images/SURROUNDINGGAME_THE_AH2.jpg)

From 2012-2017 I directed a feature-length documentary film on the game of Go, **[*The Surrounding Game*](https://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/)**. 
The project was a community-supported labor of love, a crazy adventure, and my attempt to communicate all the emotions and philosophical questions the game inspires in me. 

>THE SURROUNDING GAME follows the lives of three young Go prodigies vying to become the first-ever American professional players. As the competition intensifies and intricate patterns spill out across the board, their thoughts turn to their uncertain futures, and lead them on a journey through the gameâ€™s ancient past to ask what it means to live a meaningful life. Through an intimate portrait of these young players and interviews with the greatest Go masters alive today, the film explores the search for meaning that Go represents to its players, for whom the game is a window into the nature of thought itself.
